# useful_tools
Lab forum to share scripts, software, and technical issues

## Practice (feel free to edit)
### Share a script
1. Please include an information section including the purpose, dependency, input, output and your name.
2. Try to make the script self-contained if possible (namely, one can repeat the results with one command). 
3. It's also great to provide a demo run for some software you've tried

[For example]():
```
###### Infor
# Aim: download all NCBI RefSeq microbe genome/protein information
# Input: None
# Output: a folder containing genome/protein sequences for all microbes in the NCBI RefSeq 
# Dependency: None
# Programmer: xxxxxx
######

(your script)
```

### Propose an ongoing job in "Issues"
1. Raise a new issue when you're facing an unfamiliar situation.
2. Provide feedbacks if you are familiar with topics in existing issues.
3. When you finish the job (I believe you will manage to do it lol), share your script in the repo

[For example]():
```
Demand: interactively pull a subtree of the phylogenetic tree based on input species.
```
